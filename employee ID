import re

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    uid = input().strip()
    if len(uid) == 10 and uid.isalnum():
        if bool(re.search(r'(.*[A-Z]){2,}', uid)) and bool(re.search(r'(.*[0-9]){3,}', uid)):
            if re.search(r'.*(.).*\1+.*', uid):
                print('Invalid)
            else:
                print('Valid')
        else:
            print('Invalid')
            
    else:
